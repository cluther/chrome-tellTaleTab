## chrome-tellTaleTab
Simplified notification extension for a small but growing number of sites. Inspired by shikakaa's Gmail Favicon Alert extension, the notifications that there is something new of interest in the application's tab is done by the tab's favicon rather than taking up precious space in the "uber-bar."
